## Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website which can be found at https://keatonlees.com/portfolio2020. This is a place where I can showcase myself, my interests, and my projects.

### Developed using
- React
- CSS

## Future fixes, updates and additions
1. I think it would be a cool idea to add a "Travel" section to my about page. It would include an interactive map that allows a viewer to see where in the world I have travelled, my memories of each place and more!
